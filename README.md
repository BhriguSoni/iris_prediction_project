# Iris Series Prediction

TThe Iris Series Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to classify iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. This project uses a dataset containing measurements of iris flowers to train a model that can accurately predict the species of a given iris based on its features.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhrigusoni//iris_prediction_project.git
    cd image_captioning_project
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset. The dataset contains the following features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species (target variable)

### Running the Application

1. Navigate to the `iris_prediction_app` directory:
    ```bash
    cd iris_prediction_app
    ```

2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the application.



## Usage

- Input the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an iris flower.
- The application will predict the species of the iris flower based on the input features.
